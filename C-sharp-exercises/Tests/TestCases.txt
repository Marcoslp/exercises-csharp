Test Scenarios for Logger:

A. Test Case: Log a single message
Input:
- fileName: "application.log"
- message: "Test message"
- severity: "INFO"

Expected Output in File:
"[2024-09-02 14:15:00] [INFO] Test message"

Steps:
1. Call the log_message function with the provided fileName, message, and severity.
2. Open the application.log file.
3. Verify that the file contains the log entry with the correct timestamp and severity level.


B. Test Case: Log Multiple Messages
Input:
- fileName: "application.log"
- messages: [("First log entry", "INFO"), ("Second log entry", "ERROR")]

Expected Output in File:
"[2024-09-02 14:18:00] [INFO] First log entry"
"[2024-09-02 14:18:05] [ERROR] Second log entry"

Steps:
1. Call the log_message function twice with each message and corresponding severity.
2. Open the application.log file.
3. Ensure both log entries are present in the correct order, each with the appropriate timestamp and severity.


C. Test Case: Log to a Non-Existent File

Input:
- fileName: "nonexistent.log"
- message: "New file log entry"
- severity: "INFO"

Expected Output:
1. Call the log_message function with the provided fileName, message, and severity.
2. A new file named nonexistent.log is created, and it contains the log entry: "[2024-09-02 14:19:00] [INFO] New file log entry"


D. Test Case: Log Special Characters in Message

Input:
- fileName: "application.log"
- message: "Special chars: !@#$%^&*()"
- severity: "INFO"

Expected Output in File:
"[2024-09-02 14:21:00] [INFO] Special chars: !@#$%^&*()"

Steps:
1. Call the log_message function with the provided fileName, message, and severity.
2. Open the application.log file.
3. Verify that the log entry correctly logs the message containing special characters with the correct timestamp and severity.


E. Test Case: Verify Timestamp Accuracy

Input:
- fileName: "application.log"
- message: "Timestamp check"
- severity: "INFO"

Expected Output in File:
The timestamp in the log entry should match the system time when the log was written.

Steps:
1. Record the current system time.
2. Call the log_message function with the provided fileName, message, and severity.
3. Open the application.log file.
4. Check that the timestamp in the log entry matches the recorded system time within an acceptable margin of error.
